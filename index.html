        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My business management degree qualifies me to apply for HR positions as well. Rarely I could find a company who values and care about its employees as much as its customers. My passion is to ensure that employees are satisfied in order to provide customers with the best service.</p>

        <h2>My skills</h2>
        <p>Based on my academic years and work experience, I was able to develop a crucial ability to work in team environments, gain excellent leadership and time management skills, and adapt to people with different culture and background under complex conditions. I have exceptional verbal and writing skills and the ability to listen carefully and to observe how procedures and duties are carried out. My observational skills also make it possible for me to learn from sitting in on meetings and interviews. I also have the ability to work in a fast-paced, high stressful environment while maintaining a friendly and professional attitude.</p>
